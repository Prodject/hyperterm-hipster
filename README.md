## Install
Add `hyperterm-hipster` to the plugins list in your `~/.hyperterm.js` config file.


## Tip
To get the exact same look as in the screenshot, you need to use the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt and the [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugin to have commands highlighted.
